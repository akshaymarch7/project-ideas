Disclaimer: Need to research about the legal technicalities of the idea.
" Lawyers are not conferred with the right to advertise and publicize 
their work, with the aim to solicit clients. In fact, there is a 
statutory prohibition. This is enunciated in Rule 36 of the Bar 
Council of India [“BCI”] Rules read with section 49 (1)(c) of the 
Advocates Act, 1961."
